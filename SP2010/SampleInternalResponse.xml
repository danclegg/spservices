(Private)Kim sent the following email:

On April 5, 2011, there was a discussion on the CSR list about desired changes to the SW distribution site. Several suggestions were quickly implemented for a few products and I was left with the impression that additional product pages would continue to be improved.

However, today I had occasion to visit the site to download MS Windows Server 2008. Here are the choices for that product, in the order they appear on the page:

Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Data Center (32 bit) (Win)
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Data Center (64 bit) (Win)
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Enterprise (32 Bit)(Win) 
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Enterprise (64 bit) (Win) 
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Data Center (64 bit) (Win) 

All of these have exactly the same description. Of course I can always visit the MS website for a description of the differences among these products, but a sentence or two here would be welcome.

But wait! There&#39;s more! No description at all is displayed for the following item:

Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise (64 bit) (Win) 
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard (64 bit) (Win) 

And finally,

Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Standard (64 bit) (Win) 

This is the only description of any version of Windows Server 2008 that actually addresses the specific product.

Three suggestions (pleas) for improvement on this page:

1. Toss out the description from the box and replace it with a brief description of the specific product. Or have a paragraph before the section on Server 2008 explaining -- briefly -- the differences between Data Center, Enterprise and Standard versions, and R2 version.

2. Devise a clearer method of organizing the choices. The current method appears to be strictly alphabetical which I don&#39;t find helpful for these products. I was looking for 2008 Standard - 32 bit, which it appears we don&#39;t have, but that was difficult to determine until I copied and pasted the product names here. Here are a couple of alternative suggestions for ordering them.

First
MS Windows Server 2008 32-bit choices
   Data Center
   Enterprise
MS Windows Server 2008 64-bit choices
   Data Center
   Enterprise
   Standard
MS Windows Server 2008 R8 64-bit choices
   Data Center
   Enterprise
   Standard

Second
MS Windows Server 2008 Data Center Choices
  32-bit
  64-bit
  R2 64-bit
MS Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Choices
  32-bit
  64-bit
  R2 64-bit
MS Windows Server 2008 Standard Choices
  64-bit
  R2 64-bit

3. Put in a drop-down menu or other navigating aid to sections on this page. There are just too many choices and the descriptions are too long (and not particularly helpful) to find products easily. For example,

&amp;quot;	...
&amp;quot;	MathWorks
&amp;quot;	MediaNotes
&amp;quot;	Microsoft
o	Desktop Optimization Pack
o	Exchange Server
o	Expressions Studio
o	Office
o	Operations Manager
o	Project
o	SharePoint Server
o	SQL Server
o	System Center Data Protection Manager
o	Visio
o	Visual Studio
o	Windows 7
o	Windows Server
o	Windows Vista
o	Windows XP
&amp;quot;	National Instruments
&amp;quot;	Oracle Corporation
&amp;quot;	...
Thanks for considering these suggestions.
